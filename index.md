# L8 Protocol — v0.1

**Trustless webhook delivery via Ed25519 public key handshake.**

No shared secrets. No central authority. Ownership proven once via a signed challenge.
All future deliveries carry headers the receiver verifies locally — no database lookup, no round-trip.

---

## Why L8

Traditional webhook security stores a shared HMAC secret on both sides. That secret can be stolen, logged by accident, or forgotten to rotate. A compromised secret lets anyone forge deliveries silently.

L8 replaces the shared secret with public key cryptography. There is no secret to steal from a database. Verification is a single local `Ed25519.verify()` call against a cached public key — microseconds, zero network calls.

---

## How it works

1. Receiver publishes a public key at `GET /.well-known/l8`
2. Sender fetches that key and issues a signed challenge to prove both parties own their private keys
3. Trust is cached to disk as `l8-trust/{domain}.json` — the handshake runs once per domain
4. Every webhook delivery carries `X-L8-Signature` headers the receiver verifies locally

---

## Receiver endpoints (implement these to support L8)

### GET /.well-known/l8

```json
{
  "protocol_version":     "0.1",
  "service_name":         "your-service",
  "public_key":           "<base64 Ed25519 public key>",
  "challenge_endpoint":   "/l8/challenge",
  "supported_algorithms": ["ed25519"],
  "capabilities":         ["signed_payloads"]
}
```

### POST /l8/challenge

Sender request:
```json
{
  "challenge_id":      "<uuid>",
  "nonce":             "<uuid>",
  "timestamp":         1740000000,
  "sender_public_key": "<base64 Ed25519 public key>",
  "signature":         "<base64 Ed25519 sig of 'challenge_id:nonce'>"
}
```

Your response:
```json
{
  "challenge_id":        "<same uuid>",
  "nonce":               "<same nonce>",
  "receiver_signature":  "<base64 Ed25519 sig of 'challenge_id:nonce'>",
  "receiver_public_key": "<base64 Ed25519 public key>"
}
```

**Reject if:** timestamp is older than 5 minutes, or nonce has been seen before (replay protection).

## Signed delivery headers

After trust is established, all webhook POST requests include:

```
X-L8-Delivery-Id: <uuid>
X-L8-Timestamp:   <unix seconds>
X-L8-Key-Id:      <base64 first 8 bytes of sender public key>
X-L8-Signature:   <base64 Ed25519 sig of '{delivery_id}.{timestamp}.{base64(sha256(body))}'>
```

---

## Verification

```python
import base64, hashlib
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519 import Ed25519PublicKey

def verify_l8(headers, body: bytes, sender_public_key_b64: str):
    pub = Ed25519PublicKey.from_public_bytes(base64.b64decode(sender_public_key_b64))
    delivery_id = headers["X-L8-Delivery-Id"]
    timestamp   = headers["X-L8-Timestamp"]
    body_hash   = base64.b64encode(hashlib.sha256(body).digest()).decode()
    msg = f"{delivery_id}.{timestamp}.{body_hash}".encode()
    sig = base64.b64decode(headers["X-L8-Signature"])
    pub.verify(sig, msg)  # raises InvalidSignature if tampered
```

**On verification failure:** re-fetch the sender's `/.well-known/l8` to get a fresh public key (handles key rotation), then retry once before rejecting.

---

## Trust cache

One file per trusted domain: `l8-trust/{domain}.json`

```json
{
  "domain":           "https://example.com",
  "public_key":       "<base64>",
  "validated_at":     1740000000,
  "protocol_version": "0.1",
  "capabilities":     ["signed_payloads"]
}
```

To revoke: delete the file. The handshake re-runs on next delivery.

---

## Key management

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Environment variable | `L8_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64 raw Ed25519 private key>` |
| Key file | `.l8-key` — raw bytes, auto-generated on first start |

Only the private key is needed. The public key is derived from it.

---

## Graceful degradation

L8 is opt-in. If `/.well-known/l8` returns non-200, delivery proceeds without signed headers. Receivers that don't implement L8 are completely unaffected.

---

## Roadmap

| Version | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| **0.1** | Signed delivery, challenge handshake, trust cache ← *current* |
| 0.2 | Payload encryption using receiver public key |
| 0.3 | Formalized key rotation and trust expiry |
| 1.0 | Stable — no breaking changes |
